# 🌿 Smart Irrigation and Water Management Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This web application provides farmers with accurate water usage recommendations to avoid over-irrigation or under-irrigation. It allows users to input key information like crop type, soil type, moisture level, and planting date, and returns how much water is needed — all in a clean, simple interface.
